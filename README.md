- **Fellowship on Autonomous Learning in Engineering** (March 2024 - Present) [Project Link](https://innovacioneducativa.upm.es/proyectos-ie/informacion?anyo=2023-2024\&id=1160)  
  Participated in an educational innovation project aimed at enhancing autonomous learning for engineering students at ETSIAE. Tasks included managing databases, using APIs, and executing algorithms in the cloud using Python. This will be OpenSource in a near future, once is finished.

- **GPU's Research Fellowship** (May 2023 - Oct 2023) [Paper Link](https://github.com/jahrWork/GPU-Parallel/blob/pedro/GPU_Parallel_Processing.pdf)  
  Developed strategies for parallel processing of numerical calculations on GPU graphics cards at the Center for Computational Simulation (CCS), UPM. Evaluated performance of numerical computations on single-core, multi-core processors, and GPUs using Fortran, Python, MATLAB, and C.

## ðŸš€ Projects

- **aerovault.es** (Active Soon) [Website](https://aerovault.es)  
  A web platform dedicated to providing a free and ad-free environment for students to share and access class notes, study guides, and other academic resources. This project aims to promote collaboration and mutual support among students, by prioritizing knowledge sharing without any expectations of compensation or commercial intent.

- **Proyecto @aeropedrax** (Active) [Youtube Channel](http://youtube.com/@aeropedrax)  
  An initiative aimed at easing the transition to university life by providing useful videos, including concise and introductory classes. The project focuses on offering accessible and valuable content to help new students navigate their first year. All resources are freely available for anyone to use.
- **LoRaCIU** (Side-Project, Active) [Proposal Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XCr5UZhO-WNDkvoavmJH12rydyfWYi3e/view?usp=sharing)  
  A proposal for the [ActÃºa UPM 2022](https://www.upm.es/Investigacion/innovacion/CreacionEmpresas/Servicios/Competicion_Creacion_Empresas) to provide LoRaWAN coverage for IoT on the Helium Network (now running on Solana). Co-operated with another ETSIAE student.
